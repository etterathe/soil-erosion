Soil erosion data analysis and modelling with GeoTIFF files

# Data

The GeoTIFF file was too big to upload so there's one file missing. Before running the notebook please take it into consideration. Data was analyzed locally so this file has to be added into directory with jupyter notebook.

# Model
For semantic segmentation I used Unet model with resnet34 as its backbone. Those two are predefinied in segmentation models library.
